# MCTS-Stratego
A modern iteration of the classical strategy game of Stratego featuring a reinforcement learning based Monte Carlo Tree Search AI. The game also features two other AI modes, labeled as aggressive and defensive respectively. To move pieces, simply click on the piece you want to move and then the space you want it to move to. I used the pygame module to design the UI and some of the mechanics for the game.

This is my first relatively large, independent project. Hope you enjoy!
