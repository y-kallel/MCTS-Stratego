# MCTS-Stratego
Modern iteration of the classic strategy board game of Stratego. Features an adaptive opponent AI created using Monte Carlo Tree Search and reinforcement learning principals. The game also features two other AI modes, labeled as aggressive and defensive respectively. To move pieces, simply click on the piece you want to move and then the space you want it to move to. I used the pygame module to design the UI and some of the mechanics for the game.

This is my first relatively large, independent project completed at the end of CMU's introductory CS course, 15112. Hope you enjoy!
